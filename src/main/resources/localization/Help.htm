<h1>ReaderMap help</h1>
ReaderMap helps you to organize your reading and improves your learnig.
<h2>How doest it works</h2> 
While you are reading an e-book with your e-book reader you may want to underline some 
pieces of text with a particular meaning for you, or add some notes and comments.
As long as you add notes or emphasize important concepts your reader stores these 
information into a plain text file. Unfortnately this file is not very useful because 
its contents are mixed-up and it is impossible for a human to recover notes and emphasized
text in a sensible view. <br />
ReaderMap bring this file into a conceptual map starting from 
the book and inserting your annotations under the proper chapter in a hyerarchical 
view. Then you can
refine this repreesentation and transform it into a <cite>mind-map</cite> using 
<a href="http://freemind.sourceforge.net/">FreeMind</a>.<br />
<h2>How to use ReaderMap</h2>
<ol>
<li>Locate in your book reader the <u>MyClippings.txt</u> file</li>
<li>Save a copy of this file to your pc</li>
<li>Run the ReaderMap and press the <cite>Import my clippings</cite> button</li>
<li>Select a book from the list displayed on the right upper panel</li>
<li>Insert the table of contents: you can generate it, import from an external file or create in place</li>

</ol>
<h2>Table of contents: how to's</h2>
To organize better your notes and highlights it is important to have the book structure and the table of contents.
You have many ways to have the table of contents, but the better one is making the
<em>ReaderMap</em> generate it for you. This is possible only if you mark every chapter 
as long as you read the book adding a special note to it as described later.
<h3>How to generate the table of contents (ToC)</h3>
To have the ToC automatically generated for your e-books you must follows a simple 
rules while reading the book: mark every chapter title with a note starting with a 
special character, for example a <cite>paragraph</cite> <b>§</b> character. <br />
For example: 
<ul>
<li>Select the chapter title</li>
<li>Press <code>Add note</code> option</li>
<li>Write: <code>§</code> or other special character you have assign in the program settings</li>
<li>Press <code>Save</code></li>
</ul>
<h3>How to load the table of contents</h3>
You can write on yourself the ToC with
a simple <cite>plain text editor</cite>, and then import. <br />
Start a new line for each chapter and add the following informations according to the format:
<ul>
<li>Title: the chapter title (characters, numbers and punctuations) </li>
<li>press <code>tab</code></li>
<li>Number: the chapter number (characters, numbers and punctuations)</li>
<li>press <code>tab</code></li>
<li>Begin: beginnig position, you must get it from the reader, (integer number)</li>
<li>press <code>tab</code></li>
<li>End: ending position, you can leave blank, (integer number)</li>

<li>press <code>tab</code></li>
<li>Hierarchy level: (integer number)</li>
<li>press <code>Enter</code></li>
</ul>
Then press the <code>Import table of contents</code> button.
<h3>How to create the table of contents</h3>
You can create the ToC with ReaderMap.<br />
In the <cite>Chapter</cite> frame of the program you must
fill the new chapter input text fields: the <cite>Title</cite>, the <cite>Number</cite>, 
the <cite>Start position</cite>, and optionally the <cite>Comment</cite>. Then
press the <cite>Add Chapter</cite> button. <br />
If you want to change a chapter,
